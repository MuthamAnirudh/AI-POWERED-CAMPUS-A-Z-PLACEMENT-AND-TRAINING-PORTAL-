"""
Campus Placement Portal — Advanced AI/ML Intelligence Service (FastAPI)

This is a SEPARATE, ADDITIVE microservice that sits alongside the existing
Express `backend/` (which still powers Ask AI / Resume-JD chat-style calls
unchanged). This service adds the heavier ML/NLP capabilities that don't fit
a simple LLM-proxy pattern:

  /parse/*      resume + JD parsing (PyPDF2/docx + spaCy/NLP + LLM enrichment)
  /roadmap/*    week-by-week actionable "build this next" career roadmaps
  /match/*      semantic (vector) skill/resume matching — FAISS/Qdrant/Pinecone
  /interview/*  Whisper speech-to-text + NLP/sentiment analysis + multi-turn AI mock interviewer
  /adaptive/*   Adaptive Skill Diagnostic Engine (IRT-based quiz + coding assessment)
  /market/*     Skill Gap & Market Intelligence Radar (live + cached job-market data)

Nothing in the existing frontend or Express backend is modified in a
breaking way — the frontend calls this service ONLY when a URL is configured
in Settings → AI/ML Intelligence Service, and every feature that uses it has
a working fallback when it isn't configured, so no previously-built feature
is ever removed or made worse.
