"""
AI Career Path Predictor.

New AI/ML capability (not just a deepening of the existing 3). Given a student's current
skills and/or per-topic mastery from the Adaptive Diagnostic Engine, scores them against a
curated set of career archetypes (data/career_paths.json) by skill overlap, and returns a
ranked list of "you're closest to X" tracks with the concrete milestone roadmap for each.

Follows the same offline-first pattern as market_intel.py and roadmap.py: the ranking and
milestones always work with zero external calls (pure set-overlap scoring against the
curated dataset), and — only if an LLM provider key is configured — an optional short
natural-language rationale is layered on top of the #1 match. A failed/unconfigured LLM
call degrades to the deterministic rationale, never an error.
